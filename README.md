# 🔬 arXiv Notification Bot

A powerful Telegram bot that sends you notifications when new research papers are published on arXiv based on your interests. Stay updated with the latest research in your field with a user-friendly, button-driven interface.

## ✨ Features

- 📋 **Flexible Subscriptions**: Subscribe to both keywords and official arXiv categories.
- 🔔 **Real-time Notifications**: Get notified when new papers match your interests.
- 🤖 **Interactive Buttons**: Easily manage subscriptions and browse categories with a full button-based interface.
- 🏷️ **Category Support**: Subscribe to a wide range of official arXiv categories like `cs.AI`, `cs.LG`, `cond-mat`, etc.
- 🔍 **Smart Search**: Keyword search across titles and abstracts.
- ⚙️ **Configurable**: Customize check intervals, message formatting, and more.

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8 or higher
- A Telegram Bot Token (get one from [@BotFather](https://t.me/BotFather))

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone <your-repo-url>
   cd arxiv_bot
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Set up environment variables**:
   Create a `.env` file in the `config/` directory:
   ```env
   TELEGRAM_API_TOKEN=your_telegram_bot_token_here
   ```

4. **Run the bot from the project root**:
   ```bash
   python src/arxiv_bot.py
   ```

## 🤖 Bot Interface

The bot is designed to be fully interactive, with buttons guiding you through all its features.

| Button | Action |
|---|---|
| 📚 **Browse Categories** | Shows a list of popular arXiv categories to subscribe to with a single click. |
| 📋 **My Subscriptions** | View and manage your current subscriptions. Each subscription has an "Unsubscribe" button. |
| ❓ **Help** | Displays a help message with instructions on how to use the bot. |
| ⬅️ **Back to Main Menu** | Available in all sub-menus to easily navigate back. |

You can also use traditional commands like `/subscribe <keyword>` to subscribe to custom topics.

## 📂 File Structure

```

## 🔧 How It Works

The bot's functionality is split into two main parts: handling user interactions and periodically checking for new papers.

### 1. Parsing Papers from arXiv

- **What happens**: The bot uses the official `arxiv` Python library to connect to the arXiv API. When a user subscribes to a topic or a scheduled check runs, the `search_arxiv` function in `src/arxiv_search.py` is called.
- **How it works**:
  - **Category Search**: If you subscribe to a category (e.g., `cs.AI`), the bot constructs a query like `cat:cs.AI`.
  - **Keyword Search**: For keywords (e.g., "machine learning"), it builds a query like `ti:"machine learning" OR abs:"machine learning"` to search in the title and abstract.
  - **Filtering**: The search results are sorted by submission date, and only papers published within a configured time window (e.g., the last 24 hours) are considered new.
  - **Data Extraction**: For each new paper, the bot extracts the title, authors, summary (abstract), publication date, and a direct link to the PDF.

### 2. Notification Schedule

- **When it happens**: The bot checks for new articles at a regular interval, which is set to **every 60 minutes** by default. You can change this by setting the `CHECK_INTERVAL_MINUTES` variable in the `config/.env` file.
- **How it works**:
  - **Job Scheduler**: The `check_new_articles` function in `src/arxiv_bot.py` is scheduled to run automatically.
  - **Unique Topics**: It gathers all unique topics from all users' subscriptions to avoid redundant searches.
  - **Notification Delivery**: For each topic, it performs a search and, if new papers are found, it sends a notification to every user subscribed to that topic.
  - **Duplicate Prevention**: To avoid sending the same notification multiple times, the bot keeps a record of every paper it sends in `database/notified_articles.json`.

## ⚙️ Configuration

Customize the bot's behavior by creating a `.env` file in the `config/` directory. See `config/.example.env` for all available options.

### Required
- `TELEGRAM_API_TOKEN`

### Optional
- `CHECK_INTERVAL_MINUTES`
- `DAYS_BACK_FOR_NEW_ARTICLES`
- `MAX_RESULTS_PER_SEARCH`
- `MAX_ABSTRACT_LENGTH`
- ...and more.
